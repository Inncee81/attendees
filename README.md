This tiny web-app will help you maintain your attendance record for virtual classes.

### How it Works
1. You use your Google account to login. All the security is provided by Google.
2. You give us permission to access your Google Drive.
3. You create a Sheet with us, which creates a spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
4. You send a link to your students with which they can mark their attendance.

## For Teachers
If you're a teacher, login with your Google account and let us manage your Google Sheets for the attendance record.
This is 100% safe and open source which means you can see the code that runs this website.

## For Students
If you're a student, you'll be given a link by your teacher with which you can visit to submit your attendance.
